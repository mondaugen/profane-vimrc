# Stuff for vim

## Install

execute `./install` from this directory.
This will create symbolic links in your home directory to the .vimrc and other
necessary files in this directory

## Customization

change the ~/.vimrc, it will update the one in this repository.

`.profane/ctags-id-list` is a file containing stuff that ctags should ignore.
Add to this if you find more stuff.
